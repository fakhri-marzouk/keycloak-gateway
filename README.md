# Keycloak Gateway

## Project Description

This project is a Spring Boot application that serves as a gateway for integrating Keycloak authentication into your applications. It is designed to provide a seamless and secure integration with Keycloak, allowing you to easily implement authentication and authorization features in your Spring Boot applications.

### Tools Used

- **Spring Boot 3.0.6**: The project is built on the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and convention-over-configuration approach for building production-ready applications.

- **Keycloak Admin Client 22.0.5**: Integration with Keycloak is facilitated through the use of the Keycloak Admin Client, allowing the application to interact with Keycloak for user authentication and authorization.

- **Spring Security**: The project leverages the Spring Security framework to manage and secure the application's resources, ensuring a high level of protection against unauthorized access.

- **Lombok**: Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code, providing annotations to generate getters, setters, and other common code structures, contributing to cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **SpringDoc OpenAPI Starter WebMvc UI 2.1.0**: Integration with SpringDoc is included for easy documentation of the API using the OpenAPI specification. This enables developers and other stakeholders to understand and interact with the API effortlessly.
